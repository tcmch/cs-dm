An existentially quantified 
proposition asserts that there
exists *some* value of some type 
that makes a given predicate 
true. Here's an example.
-/

def anExistsProp := 
    ∃ m , m + m = 8

/- This proposition asserts that 
there is some value m (inferred 
to be of type ℕ) that makes the 
predicate, m + m = 8, true. 

Basic algebra tells us that there 
is such a value, namely 4, so this 
existentially quantified proposition
can be proved and is true. 

The key thing to remember is that
a proof of such an existentially
quantified proposition is a pair.

The first element is a value that 
makes the sub-proposition true. We
call such a value a "witness". In
the example, the witness is 4. 

The second element in a proof 
is a proof of that the proposition
obtained by substituting the witness
in for the value of the variable in
the predicate is true. Here, the
proof must be a proof of 4 + 4 = 8.

A proof of ∃ m , m + m = 8, is
thus the pair, ⟨ 4, eq.refl 8 ⟩. Here we use
special angle brackets, a notation that
Lean recognizes for writing proofs of 
existentially quantified propositions.

/-
Here are a couple more examples.
Note, as with all propositions,
these existential propositions do
not have to be true.

  exists m, m > 10

Consider a familiar expression:

You can fool all of the people some of the time…
  ∀ p ∈ People, ∃ t ∈ time, fool(p, t) 
    — everybody can be fooled at one time or another
  ∃ t ∈ time, ∀ p ∈ People, fool(p, t)
    — there exists a time when all of the people can be fooled simultaneously
  ∃ t ∈ time, ∀ p ∈ People, fool(p, t) →
    ∀ p ∈ People, ∃ t ∈ time, fool(p, t)
…and some of the people all of the time.
  ∃ p ∈ People, ∀ t ∈ time, fool(p, t)
    — there exists somebody who can be fooled all of the time
  ∀ t ∈ time, ∃ p ∈ People, fool(p, t)
    — at any given moment, there exists somebody who can be fooled

/- *** ∃ Elimination *** -/
/-***********************-/

/-
Suppose you want to show: ∃ x, P x → Q.

If one assumes that ∃ x, P x, then one 
can assume there is some specific value,
w, such that P w is true. If one can then 
show, without making additional assumptions 
about w, that some conclusion, Q (that does
not depend on w), follows, then one has shown
that Q follows from the mere existence of a
w with property P, and thus from ∃ x, P x. 

The formal rule is a little bit involved. 
Here it is as an inference rule. We explain
each piece below.

∀ {Q : Prop}, ∀ {T : Type }, ∀ { P : T → Prop},
pfEx: (∃ x : T, P x), pfP2Q: ∀ w : T, P w → Q
----------------------------------------------
               Q

Ignore the implicit parameters for a moment,
and focus on pfEx and pfP2Q. This rule says 
that (1) if there is some object, x that has
property P, and (2) if whenever *any* object 
has this property, Q follows, then Q follows.

This is the elimination rule for ∃. It 
lets you draw a conclusion, Q, from the
premise that ∃ x, P x (there is an x with
property P) and from a proof that if any 
x has this property (and we just assumed
there is one) then there is a proof of Q.

The following function shows all of the
pieces needed to use exists.elim and how
to use it. Note that the conclusion, Q,
the type of elements involved, T, and 
the property, P, are given implicitly,
as they can be inferred from the ∃ and
from the proof that Q follows from any
such value.
-/

def existsElim 
    { Q : Prop }
    { T : Type } 
    { P : T → Prop }
    ( ex : exists x, P x) 
    ( pw2q : ∀ w : T, P w → Q) 
    : Q
    :=
        exists.elim ex pw2q


/-
EXAMPLE. Let's prove that if there
is a value of some type that has two
properties, P and Q, then it has one
of those properties.

theorem forgetAProperty : 
  (exists n, pred1 n ∧ pred2 n) → (exists n, pred1 n) :=

      from exists.intro w Pw.left,

We'll need to understand the following fact
to fully understand the proof of the theorem
that follows. This fact says that if "a" is a
value (here of type ℕ) and pred is a predicate 
on values (or type ℕ), and if you further have 
a function that takes a value, x, and returns
pred x, then applying that function to a value
a returns pred a. Just keep this in mind as we
work through the follow-on proof.  
-/

example:
  ∀ (a: ℕ), ∀ (pred: ℕ → Prop),
    (λ (x: ℕ), pred x) a = (pred a) :=
begin
  assume a pred,
  apply rfl
end

/-
We now define two simple predicates,
gt1 (λ x, x > 1) and pred4 (λ x, x < 4), 
and two more complex predicates, P and Q.
P is the predicate that asserts that both
gt1 and pred4 are true of some x, and 
Q is the predicate that asserts that 
there is some x that satisfies gt1.

The reason for this "set up" is so that
we can state the main theorem that follows
in a way that makes cler the relevance 
of the elimination rule for exists. We
want to prove Q from ∃(x: ℕ), P x. 
-/

def gt1: ℕ → Prop := λ (x: ℕ), x > 1
def lt4: ℕ → Prop := λ (x: ℕ), x < 4

abbreviation Q : Prop := ∃ (x: ℕ), gt1 x

The difficulty of proving propositions in
predicate logic is often related to the
nesting of quantifiers. Here's a little
example illustrating such nesting.

We formalize and prove this claim: if
there is a person who can be fooled at
any time, then at any time someone can
be fooled. 

Here's a logical rendition of this idea:  
∃ p ∈ Person,   ∀ t ∈ Time,     canFool(p, t) → 
∀ t ∈ Time,     ∃ p ∈ Person,   canFool(p, t). 

Note the different nestings of the quantifiers.

Let's prove it.

Negating Existential and Universal Quantifiers

What happens when you negate an existential
quantifier? What does this mean:
¬(∃ t ∈ time, fool(me, t)) -
  there does not exist a time when you can fool me
∀ t ∈ time, ¬fool(me, t) -
  at any time, you will not fool me
Are these equivalent?

How about this:
¬(∀ t ∈ time, fool(me, t)) -
  you cannot fool me all of the time
∃ t ∈ time, ¬fool(me, t) -
  there exists a time when you cannot fool me

Satisfiability

Satisfiability is about finding values for
sub-propositions that make a larger proposition
true. We typically like to formulate these
questions in something known as conjunctive
normal form (or CNF). In CNF we have a series
of disjunctions, e.g., x1 ∨ x2 ∨ ¬x3 ∨ x4.
These disjunctions are then combined into
the larger proposition using conjunctions, e.g.:
(x1 ∨ x2 ∨ ¬x3 ∨ x4) ∧ (¬x1 ∨ x2 ∨ ¬x3).


For example, do there exist values for P and Q
such that:
(P ∨ Q) ∧ (¬P ∨ ¬Q) is true?

3-SAT

3-SAT is a special case of satisfiability (SAT) where
there are no more than 3 terms in each disjunction.
E.g., (P ∨ Q ∨ R) ∧ (¬P ∨ ¬Q ∨ ¬S) ∧ (¬P ∨ Q ∨ T) ∧ …

3-SAT is SAT, and 2-SAT is 3-SAT. The prior problems
were technically all 3-SAT.

All SAT problems can be reduced to 3-SAT problems.
3-SAT (and hence SAT) is NP-complete.

Here is one that uses all 3 terms:
