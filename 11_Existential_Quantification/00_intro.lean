An existentially quantified 
proposition asserts that there
is some value of some type for 
which some proposition involving 
that value is true. Here's an 
example.
-/

def anExistsProp := 
    exists m , m + m = 8

/- This proposition asserts that 
there is some value m (inferred 
to be of type ℕ) that makes the 
sub-proposition, m + m = 8, true. 

Basic algebra tells us that there 
is such a value, namely 4, so this 
proposition can be proved. 

The key thing to remember is that
a proof of such an existentially
quantified proposition is a pair.
The first element is a value that 
makes the sub-proposition true. We
call such a value a "witness". The 
second element is a proof of the 
sub-proposition when the witness
is substituted in. 

So a proof of the proposition, 
exists m , m + m = 8, for example,
will be a pair, where the first
element is the ℕ value 4 and the
second element is a proof of the
proposition that 4 + 4 = 8 (which 
can be produced using rfl).

More generally the introduction 
rule for ∃ is as follows:

(T : Type) (p: T → Prop) (w : T) (e : p w)
-----------------------------------------------
            ∃ a : T, pred a
-/

#print exists.intro

def existsIntro 
    (T: Type) 
    (pred: T → Prop) 
    (w : T) 
    (e : pred w) 
    : exists w, pred w
    := exists.intro w e

/-
Abstract example
-/
variable T : Type
variable witness : T
variable predicate : T → Prop
variable proof : predicate witness

def pf : ∃ m, predicate m := 
    ⟨ witness, proof ⟩

Concrete example
-/

def isEven (n : nat) : Prop :=
    exists m : nat, m + m = n

def eightEven := isEven 8

#check eightEven
#reduce eightEven

lemma pf8is4twice : 4 + 4 = 8 := rfl

-- exact proof term using exists.intro
theorem even8 : eightEven := 
    exists.intro 4 pf8is4twice

-- syntactic sugar
theorem even8' : eightEven := 
    ⟨ 4, pf8is4twice ⟩ 

-- as a tactic script
-- unfold expands a definition
theorem even8'' : isEven 8 := 
begin
unfold isEven,      -- not necessary
exact ⟨ 4, pf8is4twice ⟩ 
end

EXERCISE: Construct a proof, isNonZ,
of the proposition that there exists 
a natural number n such that 0 ≠ n.

theorem isNonZ : exists n : nat, 0 ≠ n :=
exists.intro 1 (λ pf : (0 = 1), 
nat.no_confusion pf)

/- *** ∃ Elimination *** -/
/-***********************-/

/-
If one assumes that ∃ x, P x, then one 
can assume there is an arbitrary value,
w, such that P w is true. If one can then 
show, without making additional assumptions 
about w, that some conclusion, Q that does
not depend on w, follows, that one has shown
that Q follows from the mere existence of a
w with property P, and thus from ∃ x, P x. 

The formal rule is a little bit involved. 
Here it is as an inference rule. We explain
each piece below.

∀ Q : Prop; ∀ T : Type; ∀ P : T → Prop; ∃ x : T, P x; ∀ w : T, P w → Q
----------------------------------------------------------------------
               Q

This rule says that we can conclude that
any proposition, Q, is true, if (1) T is
any type of value; (2) P is any property 
of values of this type; (3) there is some
value, x, of this type that has property 
P; and (4) from any such value, w, Q then
follows. 

This is the elimination rule for ∃. It 
lets you draw a conclusion, Q, from the
premise that ∃ x, P x and from a proof
that from any such w one can construct
a proof of Q.

The following function shows all of the
pieces needed to use exists.elim and how
to use it. Note that the conclusion, Q,
the type of elements involved, T, and 
the property, P, are given implicitly,
as they can be inferred from the ∃ and
from the proof that Q follows from any
such value.

def existsElim 
    { Q : Prop }
    { T : Type } 
    { P : T → Prop }
    ( ex : exists x, P x) 
    ( pw2q : ∀ w : T, P w → Q) 
    : Q
    :=
        exists.elim ex pw2q

EXAMPLE. Let's prove that if there
is a value of some type that has two
properties, P and Q, then it has one
of those properties.

variables (P : ℕ → Prop) (S : ℕ → Prop)

prove that (exists n, P n ∧ S n) → (exists n, S n ∧ P n).

EXAMPLE: Express the property, 
of natural numbers, of being a 
perfect square. For example, 9
is a perfect square, because 3
is a natural number such that 
3 * 3 = 9. By constrast, 12 is
not a perfect square, as there 
is no other natural number that
squares to 12. 

State and prove the proposition 
that 9 is a perfect square.

EXERCISE: In lean, the function,
string.length returns the length
of a given string. Specify a new
predicate sHasLenL taking a string
and a natural number as arguments
that asserts that a given string
has the given length.  Write the
function using lambda notation to
make the type of the predicate as
clear as possible.

def sHasLenL : string → ℕ → Prop :=

EXERCISE: Express the property
of natural numbers of being perfect
squares. A number, n, is a perfect
square if there is a number, m, 
such that m * m = n.
